**Primary audience:** Professionals, leaders, and ambitious individuals who want to improve their communication and social skills — especially introverts and "recovering awkward people."

**Primary use case:** Becoming more confident, charismatic, and effective in professional and personal interactions.
**Jobs to be done:**
- Make better first impressions and build instant rapport
- Communicate with more confidence and influence at work

- Stop feeling awkward, overlooked, or misunderstood in social situations

**Use cases / scenarios:**
- Introvert preparing for a networking event or job interview
- Manager who needs to build trust and influence with their team
- Professional who keeps getting passed over despite strong technical skills
- Someone who freezes up in conversations or hates small talk
- Coach/trainer who wants science-backed frameworks to teach others

## Personas

| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Ambitious Professional | Career advancement, being taken seriously | Smart and hardworking but overlooked; technical skill isn't enough | "Talent doesn't open doors — people do." Master the people skills that get you promoted and noticed |
| Recovering Introvert | Authentic connection without performing | Social situations feel draining or anxiety-inducing | Be heard without being loud. Strategies designed for introverts, not just extroverts |
| Manager / Leader | Team trust, executive presence, influence | Need to inspire and lead but struggle with presence or difficult conversations | Lead with charisma, decode your team, build trust that drives results |
| Coach / Trainer | Evidence-based frameworks, professional credibility | Generic coaching tools lack scientific rigor | Certified, research-backed people skills frameworks you can teach with confidence |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** People are struggling socially and professionally despite being smart and capable — they lack the people skills that actually drive career success, relationships, and influence.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Generic self-help advice is vague and not science-backed ("just be confident!")
- Academic research is inaccessible (buried in journals, not actionable)
- Other communication training is either too corporate/dry or too woo-woo/unscientific
- Most advice is designed for extroverts and doesn't work for introverts
**What it costs them:** Missed promotions, lost clients, weaker relationships, constant social anxiety, feeling invisible or misunderstood, burnout from masking
**Emotional tension:** "I know I'm good at what I do — why aren't people seeing it?" Frustration, self-doubt, feeling like there's a secret social code everyone else got but you.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Dale Carnegie Training, Toastmasters — established but outdated methods, not science-backed, not designed for introverts
**Secondary:** Business coaches, executive coaches, therapists — solve adjacent problems but don't focus specifically on people skills as a learnable science
**Indirect:** Self-help books (generic), YouTube personality channels, TED talks — informational but lack structured implementation, accountability, and progressive skill-building

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- **Science-backed**: Every technique is grounded in published behavioral research (not opinions or vibes)
- **Actionable**: Explicit "Action Steps" in every piece of content — not just theory
- **Designed for introverts**: Built by a self-described "recovering awkward person" who understands social anxiety firsthand
- **Vanessa Van Edwards**: A singular, trusted, warm voice — Harvard instructor, bestselling author, 4M+ students
- **Comprehensive ecosystem**: Free content → books → course → certification — meets people wherever they are
**How we do it differently:** We take published behavioral science and translate it into specific, immediately usable social skills with clear action steps. No jargon, no fluff, no "just be yourself."
**Why that's better:** People don't need more inspiration — they need specific techniques they can practice today.
**Why customers choose us:** Vanessa's warmth and credibility, the science-backed approach, the introvert-friendly framing, and the sheer depth of free content that proves we deliver before asking for anything.

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can learn this from free content" | Our free content gives you the what. People School gives you the how — structured practice, coaching, accountability, and a community. Information isn't transformation without implementation. |
| "$2,495 is expensive" | People School is a one-time investment (not a subscription). It's SHRM-recognized for PDCs. Students report promotions, new clients, and career breakthroughs. 98.5% satisfaction rate. 7-day guarantee. |
| "I'm too introverted for this" | Vanessa is a self-described "recovering awkward person." These techniques are designed for introverts — you learn to be heard without being loud. No fake extroversion required. |
| "Isn't this manipulative?" | We teach authentic communication, not manipulation. People School explicitly says it's NOT for people who want to manipulate others. The goal is genuine connection and mutual benefit. |

**Anti-persona:** People looking for manipulation tactics, "pickup artist" techniques, quick fixes without practice, or those unwilling to commit 1-2 hours/week to skill-building.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Frustration with being overlooked, passed over for promotions, or struggling socially despite being competent. Feeling like "something is missing" in their career or relationships.
**Pull:** Vanessa's warmth and credibility, the science-backed approach, the massive free content library proving value before asking for money, the introvert-friendly positioning.
**Habit:** "I've always been this way" / relying on technical skills alone / consuming content without implementing / assuming people skills are innate (you either have them or you don't).
**Anxiety:** "Will this actually work for me?" / "Am I too far gone?" / "What if I look silly practicing?" / "$2,495 is a lot."

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I'm smart but I keep getting passed over"
- "I hate networking events"
- "I never know what to say"
- "People don't take me seriously"
- "I'm terrible at small talk"
- "I feel invisible in meetings"
- "I'm good at my job but bad with people"
**How they describe us:**
- "Science of People changed how I show up"
- "Vanessa makes it feel like you're learning from a friend"
- "Finally, social skills advice that actually works"
- "I used to dread networking — now I look forward to it"
**Words to use:** people skills, science-backed, actionable, cues, charisma, confidence, connection, body language, communication, first impression, presence, influence
**Words to avoid:** soft skills (we say "people skills"), hacks, tricks, manipulation, networking tips (too generic), self-help (too broad), therapy (we're not therapists), introvert "cure" (introversion isn't a disease)

**Glossary:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Cues | The tiny signals you send through body language, facial expressions, word choice, and vocal tone — the core concept of Vanessa's second book |
| People Skills | Learnable, science-backed communication and social abilities (our preferred term over "soft skills") |
| Action Step | A specific, immediately practicable technique — a signature content format in every SoP article |
| Behavioral Investigator | Vanessa's professional title — she researches and teaches the science of human behavior |
| People School | Flagship 12-module communication course + coaching program ($2,495) |
| People Coach | Someone certified to teach Science of People frameworks |
| Recovering Awkward Person | How Vanessa (and many in the audience) self-identify — normalizes social struggle |

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Warm, approachable, encouraging — like a smart friend who happens to read behavioral science journals
**Style:** Personal and self-disclosing (Vanessa opens with anecdotes), research-forward but accessible (cite the study, then immediately translate it), action-step oriented (every section ends with what to do), inclusive and normalizing (reduce shame, position readers as capable)
**Personality:** Science-backed, warm, actionable, introvert-friendly, encouraging

**Voice rules:**
1. **Lead with empathy, then science** — acknowledge the feeling before citing the research
2. **Always include Action Steps** — never leave someone with theory and no practice
3. **Cite research accessibly** — "A Stanford study found..." not "According to Smith et al. (2019)..."
4. **Normalize struggle** — "Like many people..." / "If you've ever felt..." / "You're not alone in this"
5. **Avoid academic stiffness** — conversational tone, short sentences, occasional humor
6. **Be specific, not vague** — concrete examples, real scenarios, exact phrases to use
7. **No exclamation point overuse** — warmth comes from word choice, not punctuation
8. **Reframe problems as solvable** — "It's not you, it's your cues!" / "The good news: charisma is learnable"
