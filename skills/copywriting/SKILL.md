# Copywriting

You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Before Writing

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Page Purpose
- What type of page? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about)
- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What objections or hesitations do they have?
- What language do they use to describe their problem?

### 3. Product/Offer
- What are you selling or offering?
- What makes it different from alternatives?
- What's the key transformation or outcome?
- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?

### 4. Context
- Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email)
- What do visitors already know before arriving?

## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear.

### Benefits Over Features
Features: What it does. Benefits: What that means for the customer.

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
Use words your customers use. Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets.

### One Idea Per Section
Each section should advance one argument. Build a logical flow down the page.

---

## Writing Style Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Simple over complex** — "Use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
2. **Specific over vague** — Avoid "streamline," "optimize," "innovative"
3. **Active over passive** — "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated"
4. **Confident over qualified** — Remove "almost," "very," "really"
5. **Show over tell** — Describe the outcome instead of using adverbs
6. **Honest over sensational** — Never fabricate statistics or testimonials

### Quick Quality Check

- Jargon that could confuse outsiders?
- Sentences trying to do too much?
- Passive voice constructions?
- Exclamation points? (remove them)
- Marketing buzzwords without substance?

For thorough line-by-line review, use the **copy-editing** skill after your draft.

## Best Practices

### Be Direct
Get to the point. Don't bury the value in qualifications.

❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations

✅ Need to share a screenshot? Send as many documents, images, and audio files as your heart desires.

### Use Rhetorical Questions
Questions engage readers and make them think about their own situation.
- "Hate returning stuff to Amazon?"
- "Tired of chasing approvals?"

### Use Analogies When Helpful
Analogies make abstract concepts concrete and memorable.

### Pepper in Humor (When Appropriate)
Puns and wit make copy memorable—but only if it fits the brand and doesn't undermine clarity.

## Page Structure Framework

### Above the Fold

**Headline**
- Your single most important message
- Communicate core value proposition
- Specific > generic

**Example formulas:**
- "{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}"
- "The {category} for {audience}"
- "Never {unpleasant event} again"
- "{Question highlighting main pain point}"

**For comprehensive headline formulas**: See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md)

**For natural transition phrases**: See [references/natural-transitions.md](references/natural-transitions.md)

**Subheadline**
- Expands on headline
- Adds specificity
- 1-2 sentences max

**Primary CTA**
- Action-oriented button text
- Communicate what they get: "Start Free Trial" > "Sign Up"

### Core Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Social Proof | Build credibility (logos, stats, testimonials) |
| Problem/Pain | Show you understand their situation |
| Solution/Benefits | Connect to outcomes (3-5 key benefits) |
| How It Works | Reduce perceived complexity (3-4 steps) |
| Objection Handling | FAQ, comparisons, guarantees |
| Final CTA | Recap value, repeat CTA, risk reversal |

**For detailed section types and page templates**: See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md)

## CTA Copy Guidelines

**Weak CTAs (avoid):**
- Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here, Get Started

**Strong CTAs (use):**
- YES! Send my free training
- Get the [Specific Resource]
- Download the Guide
- Join [X]+ students
- Start Free

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier if needed]

Examples:
- "YES! Send my free training"
- "Get the Body Language Cheat Sheet"
- "Download the Complete Guide"
- "Join 4M+ students"

---

## Page-Specific Guidance

### Homepage
- Serve multiple audiences without being generic
- Lead with broadest value proposition
- Provide clear paths for different visitor intents

### Landing Page
- Single message, single CTA
- Match headline to ad/traffic source
- Complete argument on one page

### Squeeze Page (Lead Magnet Landing Page)
- Single message, single form — no navigation distractions
- Hero image of Vanessa or the resource
- Bullet benefits (3-5) of what they'll learn
- Social proof: "Join 4M+ students" / star rating
- CTA: First-person, benefit-oriented ("YES! Send my free training")
- Progressive profiling: name + email first, then phone capture

### Course Sales Page
- Lead with the transformation, not the curriculum
- Problem → agitation → solution arc: "Talent doesn't open doors — people do"
- Module overview with benefit-focused titles (not just topic names)
- Social proof: student count, satisfaction rate, credentials (Harvard, SHRM)
- Objection handling: FAQ, guarantee, "who this is NOT for"
- Multiple CTAs throughout the long-form page
- Testimonials with specific outcomes, not just praise

### About Page
- Tell the story of why you exist
- Connect mission to customer benefit
- Still include a CTA

## Voice and Tone

### Science of People Voice

When writing for Science of People, follow these voice rules:

1. **Lead with empathy, then science** — acknowledge the feeling before citing the research. "If you've ever felt invisible in meetings, you're not alone. A Stanford study found..."
2. **Always include Action Steps** — every section should end with a specific, immediately practicable technique. Use the "Action Step:" callout format.
3. **Cite research accessibly** — "A Stanford study found..." not "According to Smith et al. (2019)..." Make it conversational.
4. **Normalize struggle** — "Like many people..." / "If you've ever felt..." / "You're not alone in this." Reduce shame, position readers as capable people who can improve.
5. **Be specific, not vague** — concrete examples, real scenarios, exact phrases to use. Never just "be more confident."
6. **Reframe problems as solvable** — "It's not you, it's your cues!" / "The good news: charisma is learnable." Give readers agency.
7. **Personal and self-disclosing** — Vanessa opens with anecdotes and confessions. The tone is warm and collegial, not professorial.
8. **No exclamation point overuse** — warmth comes from word choice, not punctuation.
9. **Occasional humor** — "Bottom line:", "Let's face it:", friendly phrasing. Never stiff or corporate.

**Words to use:** people skills, science-backed, actionable, cues, charisma, confidence, connection, body language, communication, first impression, presence, influence
**Words to avoid:** soft skills (we say "people skills"), hacks, tricks, manipulation, self-help (too broad), therapy (we're not therapists)

### For Non-SoP Projects

If writing for a different brand, establish formality level, brand personality, and tone before writing. Maintain consistency but adjust intensity (headlines bolder, body copy clearer, CTAs action-oriented).

## Output Format

When writing copy, provide:

### Page Copy
Organized by section:
- Headline, Subheadline, CTA
- Section headers and body copy
- Secondary CTAs

### Annotations
For key elements, explain:
- Why you made this choice
- What principle it applies

### Alternatives
For headlines and CTAs, provide 2-3 options:
- Option A: [copy] — [rationale]
- Option B: [copy] — [rationale]

### Meta Content (if relevant)
- Page title (for SEO)
- Meta description
